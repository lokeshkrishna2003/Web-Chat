npm i stream-chat stream-chat-react universal-cookie for chating application after creating react app

for chatting or video applications we have to use stream.io 
there they provide an api key for us 
const apiKey = 'etm6q3knjpmk';  we have to write above the function in app.js 
const client = StreamChat.getInstance(apiKey)

create two components channellist  and channellistcontainer components and export theme inside the components directory

create index.js in components directory so that we all export the components from this file and impot them in app as 
import { ChannelListContainer,ChannelContainer } from './components';

and in index.js 

export {default as ChannelContainer} from "./ChannelContainer"
export {default as ChannelListContainer} from "./ChannelListContainer"

client work is completed now we are switching to server side 

first we will create index.js file 
and npm init -y (for direct creation of package.json )
now install the necessary dependencies
